Viper CMD 1.0.1
=====
Converted to using Python 3.

Organized and debugged functions. Made musicplay() optional based on user preferance.

Starting to gear this more towards linux as a netsec tool.

Viper CMD 1.0.0
=====
+ Python command shell
Works in Windows and Linux.
~~Full functionallity with Python2 and Python 3.

A fun project I've been working on. I want to see exactly how much I can do with a practically pure Python CMD module. Going to keep it moslty Python 2.7 since alot of modules aren't compatable with Python 3 yet. Slowly but surely will go from 2 to 3.

####Linux updates
+ Added trashbin cleanup function.
+ Now able to open Nautilus from CMD.

##To-do: 
+ ~~Get ANSI colors to work in Windows.~~ More trouble than It's worth. 
+ ~~Convert more functions to Python 3 for efficiency.

When using dirchange command the full path to directory must be put in. Working on making this easier.

##Instructions
**Linux -**
Run from terminal - python3 Viper.py

**Windows -**
Run from Python Shell or double click Viper.py. Most of the functions work on windows also, still testing on Windows.
