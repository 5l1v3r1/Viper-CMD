Viper CMD 0.0.5
=====

Python command shell - Work in progress.

Run form terminal - python Viper.py

A fun project I've been working on. I want to see exactly how much I can do with a practically pure Python CMD module. Going to keep it moslty Python 2.7 since alot of modules aren't compatable with Python 3 yet. Slowly but surely will go from 2 to 3.
