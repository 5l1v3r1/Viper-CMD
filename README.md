Python command shell - Work in progress. 

A fun project I've been working on. I want to see exactly how much I can do with a practically pure Python CMD module. Going to keep it moslty Python 2.7 since alot of modules aren't compatable with Python 3 yet. Slowly but surely will go from 2 to 3.

When using dirchange command the full path to directory must be put in. Working on making this easier.

**Linux -**
Run from terminal - python Viper.py

**Windows -**
Run from Python Shell. Most of the functions work on windows also, still testing on Windows.
